                <p>This company, and product, was founded on two main principles: creativity and sustainability.
                    We wanted to design, create and distribute a product that was both creative and sustainable with its approach and material usage; thus the Cleaning Crep was born!
                     
                    The materials that we use are as durable as possible so there are as few cases of product redundancy possible, with both the primary cloth and drawstring being of excellent durability and quality. Additionally, we believe we have created a unique spin on cleaning, with our product essentially allowing you to clean simply by walking; thus the slogan "Stepping into cleanliness" was born!
                     
                    The founder of the idea, our managing director Liv Wachowicz, came up with the original concept during a college assembly, then after some long discussions about how we could best bring the idea to fruition the Crep came to life through extensive market and material research.
                     
                    The Crep's focus is on supporting those with movement difficulties, as a portion of our team members family members, friends and more all suffer with different sorts of manuverability issues; thus we aspired to create a product that would help not only make cleaning more accessible, but more enjoyable to them as well.
                     
                    We hope you enjoy and support our product as much as we have enjoyed the process and production of making it!</p>
